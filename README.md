## Buildings
Randomly thrown about the map are bases, with a small radius around them. When one of your units stands within the circle, they capture the real estate, generating a passive income for the team. There will be a base in the very middle of the map, to help stop turtling. There will also be bases on the very edges, being the restaurant, otherwise known as the mafia headquarters, losing the game on capture.

Two types of buildings, those that give MONEY when captured, and those that give INFLUENCE. With money you can purchase units, and then with INFLUENCE you can deposit that into the TOWN HALL. If you and your opponent are both alive at the end, whoever has the most influence in TOWN HALL wins. (If you get to a certain threshold, you elect your own politician and win.)
